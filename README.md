Sudoku-Solver
=============

Solves sudoku puzzles.

Currently there is not way to input the sudoku puzzle while its running. You have to input it into the variable `startingGrid` as a 9x9 matrix.

To fix whitespacing, set your editor's tab width to 3.

## Setup ##

Create a new Java project in Eclipse and set up a `sudokusolver` package to import all of the .java files into, like shown below:
